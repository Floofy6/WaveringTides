Below is a step-by-step development plan focusing on core features, optimization, functionality, and providing an excellent UI/UX for an Old School Runescape–inspired idle game (similar to Melvor Idle). The plan is divided into phases to gradually build out a robust system while ensuring a polished user interface and smooth user experience.
Phase 1: Foundations & MVP
1. Project Setup
Directory Structure: Create a clear front-end and back-end separation (e.g., frontend/ and backend/) with domain-driven folders (e.g., domain, application, infrastructure, presentation, shared).
Tooling:
Frontend with React + TypeScript (or Next.js + TypeScript).
Backend with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript (or a framework like NestJS).
State management pattern (React Context, Redux, or Zustand).
TailwindCSS for styling (featuring custom theming).
Basic CI/CD: Set up linting, formatting (Prettier), and a Git-based workflow.
2. Core Domain Structures
Player: Holds gold, skills, inventory, equipment, health, and combat state.
Skill: Level, XP, XP per action, active/inactive status.
Item: Unique ID, name, quantity, item type (resource/equipment/consumable), optional stats/slot.
Enemy: Name, stats (attack/defense/health), loot table.
GameState: Wraps player data plus any global data (e.g., used for saving/loading).
Repositories: In-memory for an MVP (later swap to a database).
3. Initial Data & Constants
Skill IDs: Basic (e.g., Attack, Strength, Defence, Hitpoints, Woodcutting, Fishing, etc.).
Item Definitions: A few starting items (e.g., logs, fish, bronze sword).
Enemy Definitions: Goblin, rat, spider, etc., each with base stats & simple loot.
4. Minimal Idle Loop
GameTick: A front-end or back-end interval that updates the game state (e.g., every second).
Skill Updates: If a skill is active, accumulate XP or resources over time.
Combat Updates: If the player is in combat, process a combat round automatically.
Goal: Demonstrate the basic idle mechanics: start a skill or combat, see progress, track XP, gather loot/resources.
5. Basic UI/UX for MVP
Layout:
Header with Player gold & toggling theme (light/dark).
Main section with panels: Skills, Combat, Inventory, Shop (for MVP, shop can be partial).
Skill Panel:
Displays skill name, level, XP bar.
“Start” / “Stop” button to toggle training.
Real-time XP updates with a progress bar.
Combat Panel:
List of enemies. Clicking an enemy starts combat.
Display health bars for both player and enemy with a simple “Combat Log.”
Automatic rounds displayed in the log (e.g., “You hit the Goblin for 3 damage!”).
Inventory Panel:
Shows items with quantity.
(Optional) Sell or drop items if desired.
Minimal Shop:
Buy/sell a small set of items.
Validate gold and item quantity.
Aim: A functional MVP with key gameplay loops (skills & combat) and a simple, intuitive UI.
Phase 2: Core Gameplay Enhancement
1. Skill Expansion & Balancing
Additional Skills: Smithing, Cooking, Firemaking, Mining, Fishing, etc.
Progression Curve: Use an Old School RuneScape–like XP formula (e.g., exponential curve for level 99).
Interlinking Skills: Mining provides ore → Smithing uses ore → Equipment creation, etc.
2. Crafting & Mastery Systems
Crafting:
Recipes turning raw materials (e.g., logs, ore) into useful items.
Optional skill level requirements & XP rewards.
Mastery:
Deeper progression beyond normal leveling (e.g., each skill has specific perks/unlocks at mastery levels).
Mastery XP bar parallel to the main skill XP.
3. Expanded Combat System
More Enemies: Differentiated by stats, loot, special abilities (poison, high defense, etc.).
Improved Combat Interface:
Animated “hit splats,” attack/flee buttons, or auto-battle with toggles.
Equipment & Stats:
Equip weapons and armor that enhance Attack/Strength/Defence.
Evaluate a “max hit” or “attack roll” formula similar to OSRS for deeper authenticity.
4. UI & UX Upgrades
Tooltips & Hover Info: Show XP needed for next level, enemy stats, item details.
Progress Bars & Animations: Smooth transitions, color-coded bars, small animations to highlight achievements or level-ups.
Theming: Provide a consistent dark/light mode with theme variables (Tailwind or CSS variables).
Responsive Layout: Ensure panels adapt to mobile and tablet screens.
5. Performance Optimization
State Management: Avoid excessive re-renders (memoize components, consider global context correctly).
Data Fetching: Cache or optimize backend requests for frequently updated data.
Efficient Idle Loop: Potentially reduce frequent intervals in favor of timestamp-based calculations (client or server).
Phase 3: Functionality & Polishing
1. Offline Progression
Idle Gains: On returning to the game, calculate the elapsed time and apply skill XP or resource gains.
Server-Side: Store last active time and compute differences on load.
UX: Show a summary (“While you were away, you gained 320 XP in Fishing!”).
2. Bank & Extended Inventory
Tabbed Bank: Sorting, searching, categorizing items (optional for advanced user experience).
Storage Limits: Introduce item capacity, upgradeable storage (like OSRS bank expansions) for deeper resource management.
3. Advanced Shop & Economy
Dynamic Pricing (optional advanced feature): If items are oversold, the buy price could rise, etc.
Additional Vendors: Each vendor specialized in certain item categories.
4. Advanced UI/UX
Notifications System: Toasts or small pop-ups on level-ups, rare loot drops.
Responsive Layout & Mobile: Ensure a good experience across devices.
Accessibility: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast checks.
5. Testing & Polishing
Automated Tests: Unit tests for domain logic, integration tests for game loops, end-to-end tests for major flows.
User Feedback: Collect feedback to fix pain points or unclear mechanics.
Refinement: Tweak XP rates, balancing skill progression, ensuring it’s neither too fast nor too grindy.
Phase 4: Long-Term Features & Monetization (Optional)
Account System: Integrate user authentication, persistent cloud saves.
Complex Dungeons: Multi-stage encounters, boss fights, scaled loot.
Clans/Groups: Allow cooperative or competitive events.
Microtransactions: Cosmetic or QoL items (if desired, carefully balanced to avoid pay-to-win).
Live Release & Updates: Weekly or monthly patches adding new content (quests, mini-games, more skills).
Key Optimization & UI/UX Takeaways
Leverage Timestamps: Instead of constantly ticking every second, calculate elapsed time from last update to reduce CPU usage.
One-Page Layout: Keep all essential panels (Skills, Combat, Inventory) easily visible or toggled.
Clear Progress Tracking: Make sure players see real-time XP bars, action progress, and next-level XP requirements.
Immediate Feedback: Show subtle animations or color changes on level-ups, item acquisition, or defeating enemies.
Consistent Design System: Reuse components, maintain consistent spacing and color variables, and keep accessibility in mind.
Conclusion
This plan balances core features (skills, combat, inventory, shop), optimization (idle loops, modular architecture), functionality (distinct skill flows, crafting, mastery, advanced combat), and a stellar UI/UX (intuitive design, tooltips, animations, theming). By iteratively building and refining each phase, you’ll produce an idle game reminiscent of Old School Runescape and Melvor Idle, with rewarding progression systems and a polished front-end user experience.
